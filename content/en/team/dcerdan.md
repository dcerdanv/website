Hi! My name is Daniel and I am a computer engineer and bioinformatician working in the Bioinformatics Unit at the CNIO.

I get a Bachelor Degree in Computer Engineering majored at the Public University of Navarre (UPNA) in 2018, majored in Computer Science and Intelligent Systems. Now I am taking a Master’s Degree in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM).

In November 2019 I joined the CNIO Bioinformatics Unit as a member of the GENCODE project. After that, since June 2020, I have been part of an investigation on structural variation under the supervision of Fatima Al Shahrour and Tomás Di Doménico.

I have always been interested in Health and Biology, so I would like to work in this area and apply my experience in field of Machine Learning to solve questions in Cancer Biology; besides continue improving my skills.
