Hi there!

I am Gonzalo Gómez (but people often call me Gon), a computational biologist with research expertise in the analysis of biological high-throughput experiments and cancer multi-omics data. I also enjoy teaching bioinformatics and molecular biology.

I studied the BSc in "Molecular Biology and Biochemistry" at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid ([UAM](http://www.uam.es/ss/Satellite/en/home.htm)). There I got a collaboration grant with the UAM Molecular Biology department to study the relationships between transcriptional regulation and chromatin structural complexes at [CBM Severo Ochoa](http://www.cbm.uam.es/joomla-rl/index.php/en/). In this time, I became more and more interested in translational research and the molecular biology of complex human diseases. Accordingly, I move in 2001 to Enrique Caso’s lab in the Clinical Oncology department at [Hospital Ramón y Cajal](http://www.madrid.org/cs/Satellite?pagename=HospitalRamonCajal/Page/HRYC_home) where I got my PhD studying the transcriptomics of micro-disseminated and metastatic cells in melanoma patients. During that time I came into contact with cancer, high-throughput experiments, multi-omics and, yes, of course, an emerging (and exciting) research field called bioinformatics… and that’s how bioinformatics began for me. I decided to learn bioinformatics so I got a MSc in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at Universidad Complutense ([UCM](http://www.ucm.es/english)).

Since 2008 I have a staff position at [CNIO](https://www.cnio.es/ing/index.asp) Bioinformatics Unit ([BU](https://bioinformatics.cnio.es/)). During these years I have been working on multiple collaborative projects with CNIO wet-lab and computational researchers. From 2014 to 2021 I was also an associated professor at UAM.

Now I combine my research at BU with teaching responsibilities as academic coordinator of the "[Master in Bioinformatics applied to personalised medicine and health](https://masterbioinformatica.com/)" organised by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III ([ISCIII](https://www.isciii.es/Paginas/Inicio.aspx)).

My main scientific interests are:
- Applying bioinformatics approaches to cancer immunotherapy.
- Analysis and interpretation of cancer patients multi-omics to identify new biomarkers and mechanisms of drug response.
- Developing new bioinformatics methodologies to predict effective anti-tumour treatments.
