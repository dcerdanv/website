Hi there! My name is Coral and I work as a research technician at the CNIO Bioinformatics Unit since 2015.

Before arriving in the Unit, I studied a BSc in Biotechnology in Universitat de Barcelona (UB). During my last year, I was granted an Erasmus scholarship in Darmstadt Technical University (Darmstadt, Germany) to complete my Bachelor thesis at the Structural Bioinformatics Department, where I developed my interest in the Bioinformatics field.

In 2014, I moved to Dublin, Ireland, where I worked as research assistant at the National Childrenâ€™s Research Centre, in an experimental group focused on the study of Cystic Fibrosis.

In December 2015 I joined the Bioinformatics Unit. Since then, I have specialized in the analysis of Next Generation Sequencing data (from microarrays, RNA-seq or Chip-seq, to single-cell RNA-seq) and completed my Master studies in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.
