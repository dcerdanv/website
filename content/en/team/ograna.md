Hi there !

My name is Osvaldo Graña, and I am a bioinformatician at the CNIO’s Bioinformatics Unit since 2006. I am in charge of coordinating the bioinformatics service that we provide to the CNIO research groups, and also to some research groups outside the CNIO, with which we maintain collaborations. In this context, I perform data analysis for many of these scientific studies. Currently, most of my time is occupied by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis, which has brought me to get familiar with different branches of this technique (RNA-seq, Small-RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, BS-seq , RIP-seq, DNA-seq, Methyl-CAP). Indeed, I have developed different bioinformatic tools and specific pipelines for the analysis of RNA-seq ([nextpresso](http://bioinfo.cnio.es/nextpresso/)) and BS-seq ([bicycle](http://www.sing-group.org/bicycle/)) data, which we commonly use in the Bioinformatics Unit and which are also used by other bioinformaticians aliens to the Unit.

Prior to my arrival at the CNIO, I worked for 5 years in the Alfonso Valencia’s Protein Design Group, at the Centro Nacional de Biotecnología ([CNB](https://www.cnb.csic.es/index.php/en/)), where, essentially, I developed algorithms based on neural networks to predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins. I also wrote different programs and web servers to evaluate the quality of 3D protein models predicted by research groups in this field worldwide, in the context of [EVA](http://www.pdg.cnb.uam.es/eva/con/index.html) and the [CASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASP) and [CAFASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAFASP) international competitions.

I am involved in teaching activities in several bioinformatic aspects: I teach bioinformatics in the Master in Bioinformatics at the [UAM](http://www.uam.es/), and in the Master’s degree in Bioinformatics applied to Personalized Medicine and Health ([ISCIII](http://www.isciii.es/)), and I coordinate and participate as a teacher in the subject 'Advanced Bioinformatics' of the [Francisco de Vitoria University](http://www.ufv.es/). Previously, I was a teacher in the Master of Bioinformatics at the [UCM](http://www.ucm.es/), in the Master of Bioinformatics at the [ISCIII](http://www.isciii.es/), in the Master and Doctorate Program TADSI at the [University of Vigo](https://www.uvigo.gal/), and in the Master in Molecular Biology, Cellular Biology and Molecular Biomedicine at the [UAM](http://www.uam.es/).

By the way, I hold a BS in Biology from the [University of Santiago de Compostela](http://www.usc.es/). I also hold a degree as Technical Engineer in Computer Science from the [Nebrija University](https://www.nebrija.com/), and an MBA from the [UNED](http://www.uned.es/).
