Hi! My name is Laura and I am a PhD student in computational biology.

I obtained a bachelor degree in Biochemistry in 2016 at the University of Granada (UGR). In September 2016 I started studying a MSc in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology by National School of Health, Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ENS-ISCIII). One year later I joined the Bioinformatics Unit at CNIO to finish my master thesis which was focused on genome annotation within the GENCODE project. I am currently starting my PhD.
