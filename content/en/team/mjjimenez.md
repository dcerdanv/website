Hi! My name is María José and I am a predoctoral student at the CNIO Bioinformatics Unit. I majored in Biochemistry at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid ([UAM](http://www.uam.es/UAM/Home.htm?language=es)), and then I took a master’s degree in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the same university.

In 2016 and 2018, I was granted two summer fellowships to conduct short research projects in Kyoto University ([KU](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/)), Japan. During my first internship, I studied the metabolism of the hyperthermophilic archaeon _Thermococcus kodakarensis_. The second time I went to Japan, I was already a graduate student and I had the pleasure of working as a bioinformatician assistant in the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application ([CiRA](http://www.cira.kyoto-u.ac.jp/e/)). There I analyzed single cell RNA-seq data from transdifferenciating cells. After that internship, I was temporarily hired by CiRA to continue working remotely in that project.

In September 2018, I joined the CNIO Bioinformatics Unit to complete my master’s thesis. This work was focused in detecting germinal variants associated with adverse side effects in order to improve [PanDrugs](https://www.pandrugs.org/), our personalized drug prescription tool for cancer patients. During my time here, I have become very passionate about precision medicine and I have decided that I want to continue working in this area. That is why I am planning to start my PhD studies at the CNIO Bioinformatics Unit in Fall 2019.
